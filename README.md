// This program is for a web/mobile app game that gives a user the ability to create a player beginning at lvl 1 and choose a map and skills for
the game. The players will have the ability to lvl up and gain items along the way in their maps and battle monsters and other users to escape 
the island in a certain amount of time. The higher lvl the player is, the greater the difficulty will be to escape the island.
